	My visual argument project focuses on climate change as it calls action to how the Earth is slowly deteriorating. I utilize rhetoric to get this point across as I focused on using the “fear appeal”. I am hoping that when viewers initially see my project their eyes are drawn to it. I want viewers to gasp when they see it. This choice was made to portray the severity of the issue. The text that I included refers to how citizens all around the world are going about their daily lives without concern for the wellbeing of our world. The problem is only getting worse, which is what I hope people can extract from my visual argument.
